Coin Metrics for Python
=======================

.. note::  This module currently only impliments the community API v1. Upgrades to the community API compability and the Pro APIs are in flight.

This API for Python 3 provides a convenient interface for developers wanting to use Coin Metrics data. 

- The code supporting this can be on Github_.
- Batteries (i.e. Python :ref:`api_ref` and :ref:`usage` examples) are included.
- Manual :ref:`installation` is the only option currently; however, PyPI is currently underway.
